# Programming design, 2020 Fall
This is an undergraduate-level course that teaches computer programming using C++ and focuses on the conceptual principles of computer programming. This repo contains my solutions to the homework as well as the midterm and final projects. 

Additionally, althought I didn't attend the next course - Data structure - of this course, I self-learned the course content and finished all the homeworks. 

Professor: [Ling-Chieh Kung](http://www.im.ntu.edu.tw/~lckung/), department of information management @ National Taiwan University 

Final score: 95.47 / 100 (A+)

## Course contents
- Selection and repetition
- Digital systems
- Variables and arrays
- Functions
- Algorithms and recursion
- Time complexity and graph theory
- Pointers
- C strings
- Self-defined data types in C
- Classes
- Operator overloading
- C++ Strings, file I/O, and header files
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Template and exception handling

## Homework assignments
There are **eleven** homeworks (from HW0 to HW10) in this course. However, only the highest eight homeworks will be counted into final grades. Therefore, I only completed nine homeworks, from HW0 to HW8. 

All the homeworks were uploaded to (PDOGS)[https://pdogs.ntu.im/login] to judge the correctness of my programs automatically.

You could find more details in the directory of each homework.

## Midterm project
We solved a real-world operation research questions.\
Please refer to the `./MidTermProject` directory for project questions and our solution.

## Final project
We built a snake game with SFML, I was responsible for algorithm designing and degugging in our team.
Please refer to the `./FinalProject` directory for the instructions to run this program.
