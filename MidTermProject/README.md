# Midterm project - operation research 

## Project description
A manufacturing process in which m machines have a theoretical production rate of ai units per hour. However, as time passes, the machines' production efficiency decreases due to usage, and each machine i will have a yield rate pit, a probability or ratio between 0 and 1, in the tth hour. The yield rate of machine i decreases at a rate of bi per hour. The minimum yield rate of a machine is Li, which is greater than 0. The text also describes the maintenance of the machines, during which their yield rate drops to 0%, but after maintenance, the yield rate increases to 100% and decreases at a rate of bi per hour.

The second part of the text discusses the production process for n orders, each with a quantity of qj units to be produced using m machines. Each order must be given a time slot of at least qj units of production time, and the machines' maintenance and yield rates affect the scheduling of the orders.
